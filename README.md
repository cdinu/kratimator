# Kratimator

The goal of this project is to find and safely replace the dash in Romanian words with the non-breaking dash.
It is one of my first GoLang projects and also it was built under pressure, so bear with the code clumsiness.

ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´ Scopul acestui proiect este sÄƒ Ã®nlocuiascÄƒ, Ã®ntr-un mod cÃ¢t mai sigur, cratima-minus cu cratima-care-nu-desparte-cuvintele (aka non-breaking hyphen). Motivul principal este acela cÄƒ Ã®n mod implicit HTML desparte linia dupÄƒ minus, iar acest lucru nu este corect Ã®n scrierea romÃ¢neascÄƒ. Vizual diferenÈ›ele sunt minore (minus: `-`, non-breaking-hyphen: `â€‘`)

Exemple: "sÄƒ-l" devine "sÄƒ-l"

Abordarea este uÈ™or naivÄƒ, dar prinde majoritatea cazurilor. Sunt trei categorii de Ã®nlocuiri:

- cuvinte de sine stÄƒtÄƒtoare: _Ã®ntr-o_, _mi-au_, etc.
- terminaÈ›ii: _-mi-l_ (_dÄƒ-mi-l_)
- excepÈ›ii: _a VII-a_, 'mÄƒ-sa'

## Installation

If you are lazy, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/cdinu/kratimator/releases) and download the binary.

Otherwise, setup a Go dev environment, clone the source, do a `go build`, `go install` and enjoy.


## Usage

After having the executable in your path, use this utility as a command line to tool.

Test it with `kratimator -h`.

By default it does not overwrite files, but adds a funny extension in the same path. There is an option to overwrite the files, but you have to discover it for yourself under the `-h` flag. With power comes responsibility.

Glob patterns work very well with zsh (maybe with other shells, but I haven't tested yet). Something like: 

```
kratimator ~/some/random/path/**/*.jade
```
